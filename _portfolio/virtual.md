Everytime when we shop some dresses/clothes, how is that if we try them virtually wihout even unfolding them. So here we come with a solution to give user/customer an idea of dressing the clothes virtually. All one has to do is give simple gestures to select various options. It is very potent to give an awesome feeling of trying dresses virtually Indirectly saying we have just hacked Xbox Kinect (which can only be used to play games) for various human activities.<br><br>

Virtual trial room is a simple human machine interface. The basic idea for designing virtual trial room was to give user a interface to virtually try the dresses of his/her choice.We have used Xbox Kinect as my sensor to detect body movements and gestures. <br><br>
