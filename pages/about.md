The section has a variety of machinery that is required for the construction of models both static and dynamic. Over the past few years, this section has focused more on the ‘robotics’ part, conducting lectures and workshop on microcontrollers, sensors, actuators, etc.. Also,here first yearites get a chance to build their bots independently. These bots are then displayed in<i><b> “Srishti” – the Annual Exhibition of Hobbies Club,</b></i> and get a lot of appreciation from various professors, and other visitors.
