The aim of this project was to create a bot which can sketch any curve on a plain surface.
<br><br>
We had made a three wheel differential bot which can sketch any curve given to it. At first we have decided to make that bot operate by the help of programmable calculator but then we found another way to move a general curve. We have gone through a series of desgin change. Each desgin change made it mechanically better. Last two desgin of our chasis are available above.
<br><br>
In the first design encoder were on the outer side of the bot as encoders are sensitive so we have changed the position of encoder from outer side to inner side of the bot and we have used gear to couple encoder with motor shaft.
<br><br>
The curve that bot sketch's should be entered in the code or user can send coordinates of the point serial to make a complete figure.
