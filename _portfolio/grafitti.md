Graffiti bot 2.0 is a fully automated bot capable of creating given designs(upto dimensions 90cmx90cm) on wall or on any vertical surface. It works by spraying tiny dots(analogous to pixels in a digital picture) at the right locations to create a whole picture.
<br>
<br>It takes a lot of time,human effort and money to create graffitis on wall. Even finding the right skilled person is difficult. If a human creates graffiti, we have limited choices. Solving this problem is the real motivation behind creating this bot. With this bot, we can choose any design from web or give it a picture clicked from smartphone.</p><br>
