The whole designing process of the project includes the designing of the puppet and the platform on which it perform dance, speech, etc. For designing purpose the software used was solidworks in which we design the puppet and platform. After designing the puppet can be made by either 3-d printing or by wood or other materials manually. Different parts of the puppet if made seperately Suxh as arms, legs, head body, etc and the joined with the help of nuts and bolts. Similarly with the stage and the platform.
