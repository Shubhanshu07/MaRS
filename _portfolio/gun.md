<p style = " text-align: justify;">The idea of this project was to make a game consisting of two small robots to play with each other.Both robots were loaded with 5 table tennis balls each . Both robots were placed on a table in their respective playing zones.Both were manually controlled via USB remote controller.Each player fire balls from their robot to the opponent's robot.The player with more hits on the opponent wins the game.<br><br>

Balls were loaded in a cylinder like structure above the hitting arm.Cylinder had a capacity of 5 balls max.Each time the arm was pulled for hitting , one ball came down from the Cylinder and it was hitted by the arm. We use a elevation at the place from where the balls came out to improve the trajectory of the balls.
